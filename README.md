# Tacobell USA Website Scrape
An automation script to automate browser that will scrape restaurants' location from <a href='https://tacobell.com/locations'>tacobell.com/locations</a>

***Steps:***
1. Download the project as zip & extract it.
2. Enable **Google Drive API** & **Google Sheets API**.
3. Download credential JSON file & rename it to **cred.json**. Place it in the root folder i.e. in the same folder where **main.py** is located.
4. If the URL is **NOT** censored in your location, remove/comment-out line **24 & 25**.

***Precautions:***
1. Make sure **Google Drive API** & **Google Sheets API** is enabled.
2. Last but not the least, make sure you have a **stable internet connection**. Otherwise, the script may fail.
